# BABY METHOD
FOR THE TECHNOLOGICALLY CHALLENGED

---

1. Find a page belonging to the extension you want to disable. You'll need your extension's 32-character ID to continue. If you're trying to bypass stuff, try finding it in a filter extension ID list. For further help, check the help section.

Once you have the ID, you'll be guaranteed to get to a working chrome-extension:// page by visiting the manifest file: (with your extension's ID substituted in, of course)

chrome-extension://extension_id_here_please/manifest.json
Some extensions' pages are much easier to access directly (like their options or block pages). All that's important is that you open a page belonging to the extension you want to disable.

2. Visit that chrome-extension:// page, then type chrome://hang in the URL bar of that tab. It should start loading infinitely.

3. Right-click the tab and duplicate it. Don't close anything.

4. Go to the chrome://extensions page for the extension you want to disable. See https://ltmeat.bypassi.com/img/vid.webm

5. If that page has any sort of switch, such as "Allow access to file URLs", click that switch. If there are no clickable switches, cry in a corner or something.

The extension should now be broken, assuming you clicked the switch! Only one of the two duplicate tabs should be left standing. You can close your tabs now. Refer to the help section for more help.
